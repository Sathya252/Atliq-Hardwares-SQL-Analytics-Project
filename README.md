Image 5: Q5 Manufacturing Costs:
The product AQ HOME AllIn1 Gen 2 has a significantly higher manufacturing cost compared to AQ Master wired x1 Ms. This discrepancy indicates a potential challenge in cost management for premium or complex products.
**Recommendation:** Optimize production costs for high-cost products like AQ HOME AllIn1 Gen 2 through improved supply chain efficiency or sourcing alternative materials without compromising quality.

Image 6: Q6 Discounts Offered:
Customers like Flipkart and Viveks have received the highest average discounts (0.31% and 0.30%, respectively). Amazon, a major e-commerce player, receives slightly lower discounts at 0.29%.
**Recommendation**: Evaluate the impact of discounting on profitability for key customers. Consider aligning discounts with sales volume or loyalty programs to incentivize larger orders.

Image 7: Q7 Gross Sales Trend:
Gross sales have shown variability across months and years. A clear upward trend is visible from 2019 to 2021, especially in the first half of 2021, where sales peaked. The high performance in months like January, February, and March 2021 suggests strong seasonal demand or successful campaigns. However, sales dropped toward the end of 2020, particularly in November and December, likely due to market disruptions or other external factors.
**Recommendation:** Focus on replicating strategies that worked in early 2021. Analyze campaigns and product launches from that period and maintain robust inventory to meet seasonal demand in Q1.

---

Image 8: Q8: Sales by Quarter
Sales peaked in Q1 2021 at 14.47 million units, followed by a slight drop in Q2. In 2020, sales were much lower, showing slow business during Q3 and Q4.
**Recommendation:**
Analyze what worked in Q1 2021, such as promotions or seasonal demand, and apply these strategies in upcoming quarters. Keep improving product availability and visibility to maintain momentum.

---

Image 09: Q9: Sales by Channel
Retailers contribute 73.22% of total sales, generating 1924 million. This highlights how crucial retailers are for the company’s revenue.
**Recommendation:**
Maintain strong relationships with retailers by offering loyalty programs and better margins. Additionally, explore online sales channels to reduce dependency on retailers.

---

Image 10: Q10 Top Products by Division
In the N & S Division, Pen Drives are the most sold products, with AQ Pen Drive 2 IN 1 leading at 701,373 units. This shows a high demand for storage devices.
For the P & A Division, AQ Gamers Ms is the best performer, while AQ Maxima Ms follows closely, indicating consistent demand for these products.
In the PC Division, products like AQ Digit and AQ Velocity are performing poorly, with sales below 20,000 units.
**Recommendation:**
Focus marketing efforts on Pen Drives and Gamers Ms, as these products are already popular. Introduce promotions or discounts for PC products to boost sales.
